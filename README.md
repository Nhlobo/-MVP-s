And now, we ship that MVP!
This week is still all about execution! Hopefully you are on track and have gotten many of the riskiest aspects of your projects completed. It’s time to integrate all the pieces of your project so that you have a functioning project. The deliverable for the upcoming week will be an MVP and a self-assessment of your project.

PLD: MVP Review
During the PLD this week, these are the objectives:

Each team meets with 3 teams they didn’t meet with last week, one at a time for 40 minutes.
During the team-team meeting, each team presents for 20 minutes, then observes for 20 minutes.
When a team is presenting, they share their MVP and walk through code any they’ve implemented and technical choices they have made.
When a team is observing, they ask questions, share observations, and code review. Act more as an interviewer than a mentor.
Some things to think about
End-to-end
Prioritize getting all the pieces put together and proving the entire user experience. If you are doing a web project, lets say a food delivery app, it will be important that an order can be placed, received by a delivery-person, and marked as delivered. Refer back to the user stories and ensure each of those workflows is functional.

If you’re done early
Keep going! Add more features, tests, and polish the features you’ve completed. If you don’t have ideas for how to enhance your project, then ask your peers.
